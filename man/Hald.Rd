\title{Hald data}
\format{
A data frame with 13 observations on the following 5 variables.
\describe{ \item{y}{Heat evolved per gram of cement (in calories)}
\item{x1}{Amount of tricalcium aluminate} \item{x2}{Amount
of tricalcium silicate} \item{x3}{Amount of tetracalcium alumino
ferrite} \item{x4}{Amount of dicalcium silicate} }
}
\usage{
Hald

\description{
The following data relates to an engineering application that was interested
in the effect of the cement composition on heat evolved during hardening
(for more details, see Woods et al., 1932).
