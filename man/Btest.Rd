\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list with the entertained models defined with their
corresponding formulas. If the list is unnamed, default names are given by
the routine. One model must be nested in all the others.}

\item{data}{data frame containing the data.}

\item{prior.betas}{Prior distribution for regression parameters within each
model (to be literally specified). Possible choices include "Robust", "Robust.G", "Liangetal", "gZellner",
"ZellnerSiow", "FLS", "intrinsic.MGC" and "IHG" (see details).}

\item{prior.models}{Type of prior probabilities of the models (to be literally specified). Possible choices are
"Constant" and "User" (see details).}

\item{priorprobs}{A named vector ir list (same length and names as in argument
\code{models}) with the prior probabilities of the models (used in combination
of \code{prior.models="User"}). If the provided object
is not named, then the order in the list of \code{models} is used to assign the prior
probabilities}

\item{null.model}{The name of the null model (eg. the one nested in all the others).
By default, the names of covariates in the different
models are used to identify the null model. An error is produced if such identification fails.
This identification
is not performed if the definition of the null model is provided, with this argument,
by the user.
Note that the (the \code{null.model} must coincide with that model with the largest
sum of squared errors and should be smaller in dimension to any other model).}

Bayes factor of each model to the simplest model.} \item{PostProbi }{A
vector with the posterior probabilities of each model.} \item{models }{A
list with the entertained models. } \item{nullmodel}{The position of the

\description{
It Computes the Bayes factors and posterior probabilities of a list of linear
regression models proposed to explain a common response variable over the
same dataset
}
\details{
The Bayes factors, BFi0, are expressed in relation with the simplest model
(the one nested in all the others). Then, the posterior probabilities of the
entertained models are obtained as

Pr(Mi | \code{data})=Pr(Mi)*BFi0/C,

where Pr(Mi) is the prior probability of model Mi and C is the normalizing
constant.

The Bayes factor B_i depends on the prior assigned for the parameters in the regression
models Mi and \code{Bvs} implements a number of popular choices. The "Robust"
prior by Bayarri, Berger, Forte and Garcia-Donato (2012) is the recommended (and default) choice.
This prior prior can be implemented in a more stable way using the derivations in Greenaway (2019) 
and that are available in BayesVarSel since version 2.2.x setting the argument to "Robust.G". 

Additional options are "gZellner" a prior which 
corresponds to the
prior in Zellner (1986) with g=n. Also "Liangetal" prior is the
hyper-g/n with a=3 (see the original paper Liang et al 2008, for details).
"ZellnerSiow" is the multivariate Cauchy prior proposed by Zellner and Siow
(1980, 1984), further studied by Bayarri and Garcia-Donato (2007).
"FLS" is the (benchmark) prior recommended by Fernandez, Ley and Steel (2001) which is
the prior in Zellner (1986) with g=max(n, p*p) p being the number of
covariates to choose from (the most complex model has p+number of fixed
covariates).
"intrinsic.MGC" is the intrinsic prior derived by Moreno, Giron, Casella (2015)
and "IHG" corresponds to the intrinsic hyper-g prior derived in Berger, Garcia-Donato, 
Moreno and Pericchi (2022).

With respect to the prior over the model space Pr(Mi) three possibilities
are implemented: "Constant", under which every model has the same prior
probability and "User". With this last option, the prior probabilities are
defined through the named list \code{priorprobs}. These probabilities can be
given unnormalized.

Limitations: the error "A Bayes factor is infinite.". Bayes factors can be
extremely big numbers if i) the sample size is even moderately large or if
ii) a model is much better (in terms of fit) than the model taken as the
null model. We are currently working on more robust implementations of the
functions to handle these problems. In the meanwhile you could try using the
g-Zellner prior (which is the most simple one and results, in these cases,
should not vary much with the prior) and/or using more accurate definitions
of the simplest model.
