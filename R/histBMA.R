#' A function for histograms-like representations of objects of class
#' \code{bma.coeffs}
#'
#' The columns in \code{bma.coeffs} are simulations of the model averaged
#' posterior distribution. This normally is a mixture of a discrete (at zero)
#' and several continuous distributions. This plot provides a convenient
#' graphical summary of such distributions.
#'
#' This function produces a histogram but with the peculiarity that the zero
#' values in the simulation are represented as bar centered at zero. The area
#' of all the bars is one and of these, the area of the bar at zero (colored
#' with \code{gray.0}) is, conditionally on the retained models (see details in
#' \code{\link[BayesVarSel]{BMAcoeff}}), the probability of that coefficient be
#' exactly zero. This number is included in the top of the zero bar if
#' \code{text} is set to TRUE.
#'
#' @export
#' @param x An object of class \code{bma.coeffs}
#' @param covariate The name of an explanatory variable whose accompanying
#' coefficient is to be represented. This must be the name of one of the
#' columns in \code{x}
#' @param n.breaks The number of equally lentgh bars for the histogram
#' @param text If set to TRUE the probability of the coefficient being zero is
#' added in top of the bar at zero. Note: this probability is based on the
#' models used in \code{bma.coeffs} (see details in that function)
#' @param gray.0 A numeric value between 0 and 1 that specifies the darkness,
#' in a gray scale (0 is white and 1 is black) of the bar at zero
#' @param gray.no0 A numeric value between 0 and 1 that specifies the darkness,
#' in a gray scale (0 is white and 1 is black) of the bars different from zero

#' #The value in top of the bar at zero (0.251 in this case) is the probability of beta_M is
#' #zero conditional on a model space containing the 1000 models used in the mixture. This value
#' #should be closed to the exact value
#' #1-crime.Bvs$inclprob["M"]
#' #which in this case is 0.2954968
#' #if n.keep above is close to 2^15
#'
#' #Note 2:
#' #The BMA posterior distribution of beta_M has two modes approximately located at 0 and 10
#' #If we summarize this distribution using the mean
