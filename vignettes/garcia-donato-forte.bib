@article{KassRaf95,
	Abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of
                   probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for
                   quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific
                   theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the
                   Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null
                   hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is
                   one-half. Although there has been much discussion of
                   Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of
                   criticism of P-values, less attention has been given
                   to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied
                   statistics. In this article we review and discuss the
                   uses of Bayes factors in the context of five
                   scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology,
                   sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following
                   points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the
                   purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the
                   evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes
                   factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor
                   of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of
                   incorporating external information into the
                   evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes
                   factors are very general and do not require
                   alternative models to be nested. Several techniques
                   are available for computing Bayes factors, including
                   asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute
                   using the output from standard packages that maximize
                   likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The
                   Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough
                   approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor,
                   which is easy to use and does not require evaluation
                   of prior distributions. When one is interested in
                   estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be
                   converted to weights to be attached to various models
                   so that a composite estimate or prediction may be
                   obtained that takes account of structural or model
                   uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow
                   model uncertainty to be taken into account when the
                   class of models initially considered is very large.
                   Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary
                   model-building process. It is important, and
                   feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to
                   the prior distributions used.},

@article{BayGar07,
	Abstract = {We consider that observations come from a general
                   normal linear model and that it is desirable to test
                   a simplifying null hypothesis about the parameters.
                   We approach this problem from an objective Bayesian,
                   model-selection perspective. Crucial ingredients for
                   this approach are 'proper objective priors' to be
                   used for deriving the Bayes factors.
                   Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow priors have good properties for
                   testing null hypotheses defined by specific values of
                   the parameters in full-rank linear models. We extend
                   these priors to deal with general hypotheses in
                   general linear models, not necessarily of full rank.
                   The resulting priors, which we call 'conventional
                   priors', are expressed as a generalization of
                   recently introduced 'partially informative
                   distributions'. The corresponding Bayes factors are
                   fully automatic, easily computed and very reasonable.
                   The methodology is illustrated for the change-point
                   problem and the equality of treatments effects
                   problem. We compare the conventional priors derived
                   for these problems with other objective Bayesian
                   proposals like the intrinsic priors. It is concluded
                   that both priors behave similarly although
                   interesting subtle differences arise. We adapt the
                   conventional priors to deal with nonnested model
                   selection as well as multiple-model comparison.
                   Finally, we briefly address a generalization of
                   conventional priors to nonnormal scenarios.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the robustness of explanatory
                   variables in cross-country economic growth
                   regressions. It introduces and employs a novel
                   approach, Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates
                   (BACE), which constructs estimates by averaging OLS
                   coefficients across models. The weights given to
                   individual regressions have a Bayesian justification
                   similar to the Schwarz model selection criterion. Of
                   67 explanatory variables we find 18 to be
                   significantly and robustly partially correlated with
                   long-term growth and another three variables to be
                   marginally related. The strongest evidence is for the
                   relative price of investment, primary school

@article{BarBer04,
	Abstract = {Often the goal of model selection is to choose a
                   model for future prediction, and it is natural to
                   measure the accuracy of a future prediction by
                   squared error loss. Under the Bayesian approach, it
                   is commonly perceived that the optimal predictive
                   model is the model with highest posterior
                   probability, but this is not necessarily the case. In
                   this paper we show that, for selection among normal
                   linear models, the optimal predictive model is often
                   the median probability model, which is defined as the
                   model consisting of those variables which have
                   overall posterior probability greater than or equal
                   to 1/2 of being in a model. The median probability
                   model often differs from the highest probability
                   model.},

@article{liang08,
	Abstract = {Zellner's g prior remains a popular conventional
                   prior for use in Bayesian variable selection, despite
                   several undesirable consistency issues. In this
                   article we study mixtures of g priors as an
                   alternative to default g priors that resolve many of
                   the problems with the original formulation while
                   maintaining the computational tractability that has
                   made the g prior so popular. We present theoretical
                   properties of the mixture g priors and provide real
                   and simulated examples to compare the mixture
                   formulation with fixed g priors, empirical Bayes
                   approaches, and other default procedures.},
